# Typescript Boilerplate

My goto typescript boilerplate.

The goal of this repo is to provide an easy to understand and fast to develop with template for new TS projects.

Currently targets Nodejs 16.

The only opinionated choice I've made is including Googles typescript styling guide for a low config and consistant styling.


## Dependencies
`gts` - google typescript styling rules for eslint/prettier  
`jest` - javascript testing framework  
`nodemon` - auto reloading script runner  
`sucrase` - development hot reloading ts compiler (tsc is used for dist builds)  
`typescript` - typescript my guy
